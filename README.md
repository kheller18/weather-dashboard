Project Overview: This application allows a user to search for a city in the United States and will display the current weather and forecast for the next 5 days.

Current weather: The current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index is displayed.  A symbol appears next to the city name and date to represent the current condition.

Forecast:  The forecast is displayed for the following 5 days.  The temperature and humidity for each day are displayed and an icon represents the overall weather for that day.

Additional details:  The user's searches appear on the left side of the screen.  When the user closes and reopens the application, the last city the user searched for appears on the home page.
